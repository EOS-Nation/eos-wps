# 2020-04-10

- update `copy_active_voting_periods` to only copy over `active` proposals
- fix `copy_active_voting_periods` & `add_proposal_to_periods` to match the same next voting period

# 2020-04-09

**BREAKING** changes:
1. renamed all map<name, string> types:
- `comment_json`
- `proposer_json`
- `proposal_json` (no change)

2. actions also affected by renaming:
- `setproposer`
- `comment`

3. ACTION `activate` has modified parameters (`start_voting_period` replaced by `bool activate_next`)
> true = activate next
> false = active current

**NEW** features:
- `account_type` is added to comments TABLE (multi-index 2)
> 3 types: voter, proposer, other

- `remaining_voting_periods` has been added to `proposals` TABLE (counts to track how many voting periods is left for the proposals)

# 2020-04-02 to 2020-04-09

### SECURITY AUDIT FIXES

- add `check_wps_parameters` to for both `init` & `setparams`:
  - `voting_interval` must be equal to 30 days (2592000)
  - `max_monthly_budget` must be postive asset
  - `deposit_required` must be positive asset
  - `vote_margin` must be above zero
- rename `CORE_SYMBOL` => `BUDGET_SYMBOL`
- rename `CORE_TOKEN_CONTRACT` => `BUDGET_TOKEN_CONTRACT`
- to be eligible to comment, must be `proposer` or `voter` must cast a vote on that particular proposal.
- `min_time_voting_end` must less than `voting_interval`
- remove unused parameters
- remove `update_eligible_proposals()` executing a second time at `complete`
- fix `set_pending_to_active()` to modify multiple rows
- add explicite check for to prevent having above 100 active proposals
- retain ineligible votes
  - do not delete votes when voter becomes ineligible in `refresh_proposal()`
  - handle ineligible producers in `calculate_total_net_votes()`
  - simplify `refresh_proposal()`
  - allows voters to `comment()` if no longer eligible
- add `calculate_producer_per_vote_pay` helper method

#### `remaining_voting_periods` major change

- remove `proposals::end` value
- add `proposals::remaining_voting_periods` number which represent how many remaining of voting periods the proposal has.
- when proposal `activate` the `remaining_voting_periods` is set to the `duration` (for both active & pending proposals)
- whenever `complete` is executed, all `active` proposals will reduce -1 the `remaining_voting_periods`, `pending` proposals are unchanged.
- any proposals that have 0 duration are set to either `completed`/`expired`/`partial`
- replace `start_voting_period` from `activate()` and replace with `bool activate_next`
- don't add future or past proposals to `periods`
- when `complete` add all `active` & `pending` proposal names to `periods`
- only include `pending` proposals to `periods` when active
- set `start_voting_period` = 0 for `pending` proposals
- when `complete` update current & next voting periods to 0:00 UTC (in case multiple days/weeks are skipped, the current voting period will be set to the day the last `complete` is executed).
- set `start_voting_period` for proposals changing from `pending` => `active`

#### Breaking UI changes

- replace `start_voting_period` from `activate()` ACTION and replace with `bool activate_next` (true = activate next, false = active current)
- replace `end` value with `remaining_voting_periods` in `proposals` TABLE
- `remaining_voting_periods` number represents how many remaining of voting periods the proposal has.
